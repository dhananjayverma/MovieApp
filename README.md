# MovieApp
I have created a simple MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) web application that enables users to search for movies via the OMDB API and view the search results. Furthermore, the application permits users to designate movies as favorites, and these selections are retained using server-side storage methods like an in-memory data structure or a file-based approach. This application provides an interactive and seamless experience for users to explore movies, personalize their selections, and conveniently access their favorite movies whenever they use the app
